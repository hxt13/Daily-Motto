# Daily-Motto
"Daily Proverbs", the so-called Proverbs refer to admonitions and rules, mainly admonitions and persuasion, maintained by the KNOWLEDGE IS PRICELESS PROJECT under the Jointnow.org community, daily at Jointnow.org/21/1022 To update.

You can contribute directly under Jointnow.org/project/21/1022, and the code will also be merged into this repository by the maintainer, or by clicking the Fork under this repository. After modification or update, you can merge by request To this project.

> For language issues, you can use the language you are good at, or use translation software. Of course, Jointnow.org will also integrate translation APIs to translate the language of your region.

For the format, please refer to the format published by the Daily Proverbs, and upload after replacement.

After that, please wait for the daily push. Of course, all our mottos will be released from start to end, so your contributions may be shown on the page of Jointnow.org/21/1022 one day.
